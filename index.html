            <h1>Welcome to my Pokémon site!</h1>
            <p>Please select which Pokémon you would like to find out more about from the list below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <a href="page1.html">Bulbasaur</a></li>
              <li> <a href="page2.html">Charmander</a></li>
              <li> <a href="page3.html">Squirtle</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p id="intro">These are the three "First Partner" Pokémon offered by Professor Oak, the Pokémon researcher in Ash Ketchum's home town of Pallet Town.</p>
            <p> The following table shows each of the First Partner Pokémon and their types: </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Grass Type</th>
                    <th>Fire Type</th>
                    <th>Water Type</th>

            <p class="purple"> You should be aware that my favorite Pokémon is Gengar, but Gengar is not one of the First Partner Pokémon. Gengar is purple, just like this line of text.</p>
