# Project 0

I chose to make my Project 0 website about Pokémon. The wide variety of different Pokémon, which have different colors and for which there is an abundance of information and images available on the internet, meant that I could focus on designing the site to comply with the Project 0 requirements rather than worrying too much about the content.

index.html is the main page of the site. I used this page to link to three other pages and also as a central place to include most of the required features of the site. For example, the required table and CSS properties and selectors are used on this page. The other three pages (page1.html, page2.html and page3.html) all have the same format and are each dedicated to describing a particular Pokémon. The commentary boxes at the bottom of each of these three pages were created using SCSS inheritance. Each of these four pages contains a hypertext link to the other three pages which can be selected from an unordered list.

I used a Bootstrap 4 component called "card" in index.html. Each of page1.html, page2.html and page3.html include two columns created with Bootstrap's grid model. The first column contains some text describing a Pokémon and the second column contains an image of that Pokémon.

I included two stylesheets. style0.css includes only CSS styling whereas all of the SCSS styling is included in project0.css. project0.css was created by compiling the file project0.scss using SASS.

The @media query I included in style0.css is very basic and just turns the background color lightgray when the width of the screen is 600px or less.
